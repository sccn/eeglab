function [nearestIndex,nearestValues] = mesh_vertex_nearest(vertices,points)

% mesh_vertex_nearest - find nearest vertices to specified points
%
% Usage: [nearestIndex,nearestValues] = mesh_vertex_nearest(vertices,points)
%
% vertices is a Vx3 matrix of 3D Cartesian coordinates.
% points is a Px3 matrix of 3D Cartesian coordinates.  These points need not
% be among the vertices, but they are somewhere near to particular points 
% in the vertices cloud.  The function finds just one of the nearest 
% vertices in the cloud for each of these points.
%
% nearestIndex is the indices into vertices nearest to points
% nearestValues is the coordinates for nearestIndex
%
% This function is just a wrapper for dsearchn.

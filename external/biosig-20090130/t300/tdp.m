function [F,G] = tdp(S,p,UC,A)
%  TDP time-domain parameters
%	extracts EEG features very fast (low computational efforts) 
%     	This is function was motivated by the Hjorth and Barlow 
%	parameters and is experimental. 
%           
%  [F,G] = TDP(...)
%  
%  [...] = tdp(S,p,0)
%       calculates the log-power of the first p-th derivatives 
%  [...] = tdp(S,p,UC) with 0<UC<1,
%       calculates time-varying power of the first p-th derivatives 
%       using an exponential window 
%  [...] = tdp(S,p,N) with N>1,
%       calculates time-varying log-power of the first p-th derivatives
%       using rectangulare window of length N
%  [...] = tdp(S,p,B,A) with B>=1 oder length(B)>1,
%       calculates time-varying log-power of the first p-th derivatives
%       using the transfer function B(z)/A(z) for windowing 
%  Input:
%       S       data (each channel is a column)
%	p	number of features
%       UC      update coefficient 
%       B,A     filter coefficients (window function) 
%  Output:
%       F	log-power of each channel and each derivative 
%		in case of p=2, this is a linear combination of log(hjorth)	
%       G	log-amplitude of each channel and each derivative
%		in case of p=2, this is a linear combination of log(barlow)	
%       
% Relationship to related parameters:	
%	Hjorth's ACTIVITY   = exp(F(:,1));
%	Hjorth's MOBILITY   = exp(F(:,2)-F(:,1))/2; 
%	Hjorth's COMPLEXITY = exp(F(:,3)-F(:,2))/2;	
%		LINELENGTH = exp(G(:,2)); 
%		AREA = exp(G(:,1)); 
% 	Barlow's AMPLITUDE = exp(G(:,1)) = AREA; 
% 	Barlow's FREQUENCY = exp(G(:,2)-G(:,1)); 
% 	Barlow's Spectral Purity Index SPI = exp(2*F(:,2)-F(:,1)-F(:,3))
